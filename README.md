# | Hey there! I'm Adrian Clarck |
🎓 15 y.o. student at SENAI & High School — learning, tinkering, evolving.

🛠️ Exploring the technical world with a bit of curiosity and a lot of coffee.

💡 I like building things, breaking them (by accident), and learning how to fix it all again.

🌱 Early in the game, but growing fast.
